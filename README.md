# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Master-App

App containing character sheets, spells, and pretty much everything you need for D&D.
This is still very much a work in progress, so do be aware that even if you can store characters, most of the information must be inserted manually.
--When creating a character, changing the name away from "Name" is what marks the character as ready to move to the main sheet.
