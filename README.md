# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Master-App
App containing character sheets, spells, and pretty much everything you need for D&D.
Currently it only contains useable character sheets, and the spells tab is unuseable.
D&D.html is the old version from Alpha 1.0, while index.html is the most up to date version.
make sure that it stays in the same file structure, with keyboard.js in the same file and the images file next to it.
